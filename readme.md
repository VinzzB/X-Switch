# X-Switch Firefox Extension
 	
This extension allows users to easily switch between back-end servers by reading out HTTP headers that contain host-name information, such as X-Server. This extension is particularly useful for developers and website administrators who need to test their website or web application on different servers. With this extension, users can quickly switch between servers without having to manually remove cookies and refresh the page. This makes testing and administration more efficient and streamlined, saving users time and effort.
